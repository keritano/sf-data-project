While every neighborhood offers drastically different opportunities
and qualities of education, many students and families only know the neighborhood
in which they live. While they might understand where there school matches up against
the impressions they have of other schools, they will most likely only intimately know 
the schools they attend or live around. This focused experience makes them experts on
their own education but also leaves them isolated enough that their analysis of their
schools isn't entirely tied to where a specific school ranks against other schools.

In our project, we sought to uncover perceptions of schools in San Francisco by analyzing
Yelp reviews of schools according to their location, sorting them by zipcode and 
classifying zipcodes by median income.

We checked for missing and malformed values by name and coordinate, finding a few names
that weren't schools. We attempted to isolate and ignore them in our analysis.


2 Findings:
- Schools are very evenly distributed around the area (geographically)
- Slight increase in satisfaction in schools in wealthier zipcodes

Future Analysis:
- Breakdown by distribution of school type 
- Sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews

Checked for Missing/Malformed values:
- Checked by name/coordinate
- Ignored a few anomalies 

Story Idea:
- Interviewing people on the ground in specific neighborhoods 
- Topic modeling of Yelp reviews to find common issues
